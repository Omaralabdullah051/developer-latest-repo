            <h2>Contract Signing</h2>
            <p>Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a
                four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included
                an additional €12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The
                transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club.
                Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but
                later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino
                Pérez.</p>

            <p>Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth
                career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides,
                amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.

                Aged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1–0 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August
                2003.Ronaldo began his international career with

            <h1>2013 To 2018</h1>
            <p>
                At the start of the 2013–14 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years
                to 2018, with a salary of €17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football.[154]
                He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of €100 million
                surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior.Among his haul was his 400th career goal,
                in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he
                dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before.In the 2016–17 UEFA Champions
                League quarter-final against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him
                make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.At the start of
                the 2017–18 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3–1 win over Barcelona
                in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later
                and missed the second leg.[211] On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best
                FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or,
                receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.[214] On 16 December, he scored a free kick
                winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Grêmio in the final.[215] On 3
                March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3–1 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in
                his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to
                do so after Messi.[216] On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6–3
                win against Girona.[217]
