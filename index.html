            <h2>Contract Signing</h2>
            <p>Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a
                four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included
                an additional €12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The
                transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club.
                Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but
                later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino
                Pérez.</p>
